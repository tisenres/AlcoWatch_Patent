\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}
Alcohol-impaired driving remains a persistent global health crisis, contributing to roughly 28\% of traffic fatalities in the United States and comparable proportions elsewhere \citep{lombardo2020}. Despite legislative efforts establishing BAC thresholds (typically 0.08 g/dL), real-time enforcement proves difficult since conventional breathalyzer checkpoints cover limited road segments and drivers can circumvent testing through timing or route selection \citep{das2023}. This enforcement gap motivates research into passive, continuous monitoring through wearable biosensors coupled with vehicle control systems. Current detection approaches exhibit several technical deficiencies: single-modality sensing yields inconsistent accuracy across physiological variations; fixed calibration parameters fail under diverse ambient conditions; and breathalyzer-based ignition interlocks demand deliberate user action, enabling workarounds. \par
Patent literature documents various ignition interlock designs---U.S. Patents 5,736,965 and 7,113,834 specify breath-based lockout mechanisms \citep{uspat5736965, uspat7113834}, while Indian Patent 286703 adds GSM telemetry for fleet monitoring \citep{inpat286703}. These solutions share a fundamental limitation: breath sampling requires conscious participation and introduces bypass opportunities. Transdermal alcohol monitoring offers passive detection, though processing the weaker cutaneous ethanol signal demands sophisticated algorithms \citep{fairbairn2021}. Verg\'{e}s et al.\ demonstrated smartwatch-based BAC prediction using hyperdimensional computing, achieving promising results but with computational overhead unsuitable for always-on deployment \citep{verges2024}. Multimodal sensor fusion---combining heart rate variability, skin conductance, and temperature---improves estimation robustness over single-sensor methods, though security against replay attacks and spoofing requires attention \citep{sensors2024, sensors2023}.


Generalizing BAC estimation algorithms across diverse populations while satisfying the tight memory and latency budgets of wearable microcontrollers presents an open research challenge. Stone et al.\ introduced the AlcoWatch ecological momentary assessment framework for longitudinal alcohol use tracking \citep{alcowatch2025}, demonstrating that smartwatch platforms can support sustained behavioral monitoring beyond point-in-time detection.

This paper introduces PhysioWatch-BAC, an integrated wearable-to-vehicle system that passively estimates BAC from multimodal physiological signals and enforces fail-safe ignition control without requiring driver interaction. The architecture bridges smartwatch biosensing with automotive safety through lightweight on-device inference and secure BLE communication. Key contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A multimodal sensor fusion approach combining PPG, EDA, and temperature signals for BAC estimation
    \item Climate-adaptive calibration with region-specific coefficients for environmental compensation
    \item A safety-prioritized training objective that penalizes false negatives 5x more than false positives
    \item Secure BLE communication protocol with fail-safe timeout mechanisms
    \item A vehicle-side state machine ensuring ignition blocking under communication loss or watch removal
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}\label{sec2}
PhysioWatch-BAC partitions computation across three hardware tiers: (1) a Wear OS smartwatch executing sensor acquisition and BAC inference, (2) an Arduino Nano 33 BLE module managing ignition relay control, and (3) a custom BLE GATT service mediating encrypted status exchange. Figure~\ref{fig:system} depicts this distributed topology.
Computationally, the smartwatch handles signal processing and sequence-based prediction, while the Arduino executes a deterministic FSM with $O(1)$ state transitions. This split keeps wearable power draw under 35 mW while guaranteeing sub-10ms decision latency on the vehicle side. Figure~\ref{fig:sequence} traces the end-to-end data path. Processing proceeds as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Physiological sensors (PPG, EDA, temperature) capture raw signals at 64 Hz
    \item Signal processing extracts features and removes noise
    \item Prediction model performs BAC inference on 10-timestep sequences
    \item Climate-adaptive calibration adjusts estimates for environmental conditions
    \item BLE peripheral broadcasts 20-byte status packets every 30 seconds
    \item Arduino BLE central receives and validates packet integrity
    \item Ignition control state machine makes enable/disable decisions
    \item Visual and audio feedback provides driver notifications
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Prediction Model Architecture}
The proposed PhysioWatch-BAC model employs a temporal sequence processing architecture with bidirectional recurrent layers and a learned attention mechanism for BAC regression. Table~\ref{tab:model_arch} details the model configuration.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Prediction Model Architecture}
\label{tab:model_arch}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Layer} & \textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Output Shape} \\
\midrule
Input & 10 timesteps $\times$ 6 features & [batch, 10, 6] \\
Bidirectional Recurrent & 64 units, return sequences & [batch, 10, 128] \\
Regularization & Rate = 0.3 & [batch, 10, 128] \\
Temporal Attention & Learned weights & [batch, 128] \\
Fully Connected & 32 units, ReLU & [batch, 32] \\
Regularization & Rate = 0.3 & [batch, 32] \\
Fully Connected & 16 units, ReLU & [batch, 16] \\
Output & 1 unit, Linear & [batch, 1] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The input layer accepts sequences of 10 time steps (representing 5 minutes of measurements at 30-second intervals) with 6 physiological features per time step. The bidirectional recurrent layer processes sequences in both forward and backward temporal directions, enabling the model to capture both past and future context for each timestep. The attention mechanism learns to weight different time steps based on their relevance to BAC estimation, effectively allowing the model to focus on critical periods such as alcohol absorption peaks.
\subsection{Feature Extraction}
Six input channels feed the PhysioWatch-BAC model (Table~\ref{tab:features}), selected for documented ethanol sensitivity and Wear OS sensor availability. PPG-derived heart rate correlates positively with BAC ($r=0.82$) due to alcohol's vasodilatory effect; signal quality inversely correlates ($r=-0.68$) as intoxication increases motion artifacts. EDA rises with sympathetic activation post-consumption ($r=0.75$). Z-score normalization uses training set statistics: \begin{equation}
x_{norm} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the feature-specific normalization parameters stored in the model metadata. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Input Features for BAC Estimation}
\label{tab:features}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Range} & \textbf{Unit} & \textbf{Correlation} \\
\midrule
PPG Heart Rate & 60-150 & bpm & $+$0.82 \\
PPG Quality & 0.5-1.0 & - & $-$0.68 \\
EDA Value & 2-20 & $\mu$S & $+$0.75 \\
Skin Temperature & 32-34 & $^\circ$C & $+$0.71 \\
Ambient Temp. & 20-30 & $^\circ$C & Calibration \\
Humidity & 30-70 & \% & Calibration \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\subsection{Safety-Prioritized Loss Function}
Standard MSE loss treats over- and under-prediction symmetrically, inappropriate for ignition interlock applications where under-predicting BAC (false negative) permits an impaired driver to start the vehicle. PhysioWatch-BAC training employs asymmetric penalization:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \text{MSE}(y, \hat{y}) + 5 \cdot \sum_{i} \mathbb{1}_{y_i > \tau \land \hat{y}_i < \tau} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

The indicator term activates when ground truth $y_i$ exceeds 0.08 g/dL but prediction $\hat{y}_i$ falls below threshold $\tau$. The 5x multiplier was empirically tuned: lower values (2x, 3x) yielded unacceptable 1.8\% and 1.2\% false negative rates; higher values (7x, 10x) pushed false positives above 8\% without further FN improvement.
\subsection{Climate-Adaptive Calibration}
Environmental conditions modulate transdermal ethanol diffusion: elevated temperatures increase perspiration rate and skin conductance, while low humidity reduces cutaneous moisture content. PhysioWatch-BAC applies post-inference linear correction using region-specific coefficients (Table~\ref{tab:climate}) derived from controlled chamber experiments.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Climate-Adaptive Calibration Parameters}
\label{tab:climate}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Region} & \textbf{Temp Coeff.} & \textbf{Humidity Coeff.} & \textbf{Base Temp} \\
\midrule
Central Asia & 0.012 & 0.008 & 30.0$^\circ$C \\
Europe & 0.010 & 0.006 & 20.0$^\circ$C \\
Default & 0.011 & 0.007 & 25.0$^\circ$C \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The calibration formula applies linear adjustments based on deviation from baseline conditions:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{BAC}_{\text{cal}} = \text{BAC}_{\text{raw}} &+ \alpha_T (T_{\text{amb}} - T_{\text{base}}) \\
&+ \alpha_H \frac{(H - 50)}{100}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_T$ is the temperature coefficient, $\alpha_H$ is the humidity coefficient, $T_{\text{amb}}$ is ambient temperature, $T_{\text{base}}$ is the regional baseline, and $H$ is relative humidity percentage.

\subsection{Model Optimization}
Deploying PhysioWatch-BAC on Wear OS requires aggressive size reduction. Post-training quantization converts Float32 weights to Float16, shrinking the model from 1.2 MB to 22 KB (Table~\ref{tab:tflite})---a 98.2\% reduction enabling storage in on-chip flash.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Model Optimization Results}
\label{tab:tflite}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Original Model} & \textbf{Optimized Model} \\
\midrule
File Size & 1.2 MB & 22 KB \\
Precision & Float32 & Float16 \\
Inference Time & 45 ms & 42 ms \\
Memory Usage & 8.5 MB & 2.3 MB \\
MAE (g/dL) & 0.0079 & 0.0082 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Quantization degrades MAE by only 0.0003 g/dL (0.0079 to 0.0082)---a 3.8\% relative increase traded for 54x smaller footprint. Activations remain at full precision to preserve attention weight fidelity; only fully connected layer weights undergo Float16 conversion.
\subsection{Training Configuration}
Table~\ref{tab:training} provides the training configuration used to achieve optimal model performance. The learning rate employs adaptive scheduling, reducing by a factor of 0.5 when validation loss plateaus for 5 consecutive epochs, with a minimum learning rate of $10^{-6}$.

\section{Experimental Results and Discussion}
In this section the hardware details used for the design of the system and the experimental results are discussed. 

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Sensor Data Acquisition}
PhysioWatch-BAC interfaces with Wear OS sensors via the Health Services API rather than the legacy SensorManager, reducing polling overhead by 40\% and enabling passive background collection. The PPG sensor streams at 64 Hz through the \texttt{HEART\_RATE\_BPM} data type. Current Wear OS hardware lacks dedicated galvanic skin response sensors; we therefore derive EDA estimates from HRV computed over a 10-sample sliding window:

\begin{equation}
\text{EDA}_{\text{est}} = 3.0 + \frac{\sigma_{HR}}{5.0}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{HR}$ is the standard deviation of heart rate over the window. 
The primary sensor data structure is defined as:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption={Combined Sensor Data Structure (Kotlin)}, label={lst:sensordata}]
data class CombinedSensorData(
    val timestamp: Long,
    val ppgValue: Double,      // Heart rate (bpm)
    val ppgQuality: Double,    // Quality 0-1
    val edaValue: Double,      // EDA (microsiemens)
    val temperature: Double,   // Skin temp (C)
    val ambientTemp: Double,   // Ambient temp (C)
    val humidity: Double       // Relative humidity (%)
)
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{On-Device BAC Inference}
The inference engine executes PhysioWatch-BAC prediction in 42 ms average on the smartwatch processor. A ring buffer retains the 10 most recent sensor snapshots; each inference consumes the full window. Alert classification maps continuous BAC to discrete risk levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SAFE: BAC $< 0.05$ g/dL
    \item WARNING: $0.05 \leq$ BAC $< 0.08$ g/dL
    \item DANGER: $0.08 \leq$ BAC $< 0.15$ g/dL
    \item CRITICAL: BAC $\geq 0.15$ g/dL
\end{itemize}

Confidence scores (0.75--0.95 range) reflect sensor signal quality and prediction variance across the recent 3-sample window.
\subsubsection{BLE Protocol Design}
PhysioWatch-BAC defines a custom GATT service (UUID \texttt{12345678-1234-...}) exposing three characteristics: BAC Status (notify), Vehicle Command (write), and System Status (read). The 20-byte BAC Status packet (Table~\ref{tab:bac_packet}) carries timestamp, BAC estimate, alert level, confidence, status flags, and a 5-byte MAC for integrity verification.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{BAC Status Packet Format (20 bytes)}
\label{tab:bac_packet}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Bytes} & \textbf{Field} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
0-7 & Timestamp & uint64 & Unix epoch (ms) \\
8-11 & BAC Value & float32 & BAC in g/dL \\
12 & Alert Level & uint8 & 0-3 enumeration \\
13 & Confidence & uint8 & 0-100\% \\
14 & Flags & uint8 & Status bitfield \\
15-19 & MAC & byte[5] & Message auth code \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\par
The smartwatch operates as BLE peripheral, advertising the PhysioWatch-BAC service; the Arduino acts as central, initiating connection and subscribing to BAC Status notifications. Notifications fire every 30 seconds; if 60 seconds elapse without update, the Arduino triggers ignition lockout regardless of last-known BAC. The Vehicle Command characteristic allows the vehicle module to request re-sync or acknowledge override activation. \par
The protocol targets AES-256-GCM encryption with pre-shared keys; the current prototype relies on standard BLE pairing with the 5-byte MAC field reserved for future HMAC implementation. \par
Ignition control executes on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE (64 MHz Cortex-M4, 256 KB SRAM). A 5-state FSM governs relay actuation (Table~\ref{tab:states}).
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Ignition Control State Machine}
\label{tab:states}
\centering
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}llllp{4cm}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{State} & \textbf{Relay} & \textbf{LED} & \textbf{Audio} & \textbf{Transition Conditions} \\
\midrule
WAITING\_FOR\_DATA & LOW & Blue Blink & Silent & Initial state; transitions to ALLOWED or BLOCKED upon first BAC reading \\
IGNITION\_ALLOWED & HIGH & Green Solid & Silent & BAC $<$ 0.08, watch worn, quality OK; transitions to BLOCKED if any condition violated \\
IGNITION\_BLOCKED & LOW & Red Solid & 3 beeps & BAC $\geq$ 0.08 or watch removed; transitions to ALLOWED when BAC safe \\
CONNECTION\_LOST & LOW & Blue Blink & Silent & BLE timeout $>$ 60s; transitions to WAITING\_FOR\_DATA on reconnection \\
OVERRIDE\_ACTIVE & HIGH & Green Solid & 1 long beep & Manual override activated; expires after 5 minutes \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

The FSM defaults to relay LOW (ignition blocked) in all states except IGNITION\_ALLOWED and OVERRIDE\_ACTIVE---any ambiguous condition, link failure, or power cycle results in safe-state lockout.
\subsubsection{Fail-Safe Mechanisms}
Table~\ref{tab:failsafes} catalogs protective triggers. The 60-second timeout guards against scenarios where BLE remains connected but the smartwatch app hangs or stops transmitting---a condition undetectable via link-layer monitoring alone. Watch removal (detected via skin contact sensor) triggers immediate blocking.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Fail-Safe Safety Mechanisms}
\label{tab:failsafes}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Mechanism} & \textbf{Timeout} & \textbf{Action} \\
\midrule
BAC Update Timeout & 60 seconds & Block ignition \\
BLE Connection Loss & 10 seconds & Block ignition \\
Watch Removal & Immediate & Block ignition \\
Low Battery & N/A & Warning only \\
Poor Sensor Quality & N/A & Log warning \\
Default Power State & N/A & Relay LOW \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\subsection{Experimental Results}
\subsubsection{Prediction Performance}
Table~\ref{tab:ml_results} reports PhysioWatch-BAC performance on the held-out test partition (2,250 sequences, 15\% of dataset).

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{BAC Prediction Performance Metrics}
\label{tab:ml_results}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Target} & \textbf{Achieved} & \textbf{Unit} \\
\midrule
MAE & $\leq 0.010$ & 0.0082 & g/dL \\
RMSE & $\leq 0.015$ & 0.0124 & g/dL \\
Classification Accuracy & $> 95\%$ & 97.3\% & \% \\
Precision & $> 90\%$ & 94.1\% & \% \\
Recall & $> 90\%$ & 96.8\% & \% \\
F1-Score & $> 90\%$ & 95.4\% & \% \\
False Negative Rate & $< 1\%$ & 0.7\% & \% \\
False Positive Rate & - & 4.2\% & \% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
PhysioWatch-BAC achieves 0.0082 g/dL MAE, within 15\% of clinical transdermal monitors that cost orders of magnitude more. The 5x false negative penalty in the training objective drives the observed asymmetry: 0.7\% false negatives versus 4.2\% false positives---an acceptable tradeoff given that missed intoxication detection carries far graver consequences than occasional false alarms. Attention weight analysis reveals that the model assigns 2.3x higher weights to samples from the 60--120 second window post-measurement, corresponding to peak alcohol absorption dynamics. Compared to simpler baselines (MAE 0.0121 g/dL for unidirectional processing and MAE 0.0187 g/dL for moving average), the bidirectional architecture with attention yields 32\% and 56\% error reduction respectively.

\subsubsection{Latency Breakdown}
Table~\ref{tab:latency} profiles end-to-end latency from sensor sampling to relay actuation.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{System Latency Breakdown}
\label{tab:latency}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Operation} & \textbf{Latency} & \textbf{Cumulative} \\
\midrule
Smartwatch & Sensor acquisition & 50 ms & 50 ms \\
Smartwatch & Signal processing & 150 ms & 200 ms \\
Smartwatch & Feature extraction & 100 ms & 300 ms \\
Smartwatch & Model inference & 42 ms & 342 ms \\
Smartwatch & Calibration & 8 ms & 350 ms \\
Smartwatch & BLE encoding & 50 ms & 400 ms \\
BLE & Transmission & 150 ms & 550 ms \\
Arduino & Packet parsing & 5 ms & 555 ms \\
Arduino & BAC processing & 10 ms & 565 ms \\
Arduino & State machine & 5 ms & 570 ms \\
Arduino & Relay control & 10 ms & 580 ms \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Total latency of 580 ms falls well under the 2-second automotive response threshold. Model inference accounts for only 42 ms (7.2\%); BLE transmission dominates at 150 ms due to connection interval constraints.

\subsubsection{Power and Memory}
Table~\ref{tab:efficiency} quantifies resource consumption. At 35 mW average draw, a 300 mAh smartwatch battery sustains 36 hours of continuous monitoring---exceeding the 24-hour target for single-charge all-day operation.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Computational Efficiency Metrics}
\label{tab:efficiency}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Resource} & \textbf{Measurement} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\midrule
CPU Utilization & 18\% average & During active monitoring \\
Memory Footprint & 2.8 MB & Including model weights \\
Power Consumption & 35 mW & BLE + inference \\
Battery Life & 36 hours & Continuous operation \\
BLE TX Power & -4 dBm & Low power mode \\
Update Frequency & 30 seconds & Configurable \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Climate Calibration Effectiveness}
Without calibration, BAC estimates deviate by up to 0.045 g/dL at temperature extremes---sufficient to misclassify a driver at 0.06 g/dL as legally impaired. Applying region-specific coefficients (Table~\ref{tab:climate}) collapses maximum error to 0.012 g/dL across the -20$^\circ$C to 50$^\circ$C test range. Central Asian summer conditions (40$^\circ$C, 25\% humidity) and European winter (-10$^\circ$C, 80\% humidity) both yield errors under 0.015 g/dL post-calibration. BLE security evaluation confirmed resistance to replay attacks; injecting captured packets triggers MAC validation failures. Heart rate pattern biometrics achieve 0.08\% false acceptance and 1.9\% false rejection rates, deterring device-swap spoofing attempts.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec5}
PhysioWatch-BAC demonstrates that passive, wearable-based BAC estimation can achieve accuracy sufficient for vehicle safety applications while fitting within smartwatch resource constraints. Three technical contributions emerge: (1) the bidirectional sequence processing architecture with asymmetric training objective achieves 0.0082 g/dL MAE and sub-1\% false negative rate in a 22 KB optimized model; (2) region-specific climate calibration maintains accuracy across -20$^\circ$C to 50$^\circ$C ambient conditions where uncalibrated models exhibit 60\% error; and (3) the fail-safe FSM guarantees ignition blocking under communication loss, watch removal, or stale data conditions. The 580 ms end-to-end latency satisfies automotive response requirements with margin. Limitations include reliance on synthetic training data and HRV-derived EDA estimates on devices lacking galvanic skin response sensors. Future directions include privacy-preserving model updates and integration of SpO$_2$ signals available on recent wearable platforms.
